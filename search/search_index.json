GUI fails to connect to payload Wrong IP address or hostname Verify connection with <code>ping bushbot.local</code> or <code>ping 192.168.x.x</code>. Update the host IP in the GUI or <code>constants.py</code>. No audio stream or missing sound Microphone not detected or incorrect device name Check physical mic connection. If using a new USB mic, update <code>AUDIO_DEVICE_NAME</code> in <code>constants.py</code> to match the detected device (<code>arecord -l</code> to list). Audio delay or stuttering Network latency or buffer mismatch Use a lower video resolution or shorter audio buffer in the GStreamer pipeline. Check Wi-Fi signal strength and stability. No AI detections appear Missing or incorrect model paths Confirm the YOLOv11s and PANNs model weights are present in the <code>models/</code> folder. <code>ModuleNotFoundError</code> or package import failure Virtual environment not activated Activate the venv before running: <code>source venv/bin/activate</code> (Linux/macOS) or <code>.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate</code> (Windows). PyGObject installation failed Command executed in the wrong terminal Run the setup inside the MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit terminal, not PowerShell or CMD. Then re-run Software Setup. GStreamer not found / \u201cnot in PATH\u201d Environment variable not updated Add <code>C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin</code> to the Windows System Path and restart VS Code or your terminal. <code>pkg-config</code> or compiler errors Incomplete MSYS2 installation Re-install build tools and packages following Software Setup. GUI opens but screen stays blank Dependency mismatch or missing Qt module Ensure Python \u22653.11, then reinstall dependencies with <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>. Pi fails to reconnect after disconnect Network drop or static IP conflict Make sure both host and Pi are on the same Wi-Fi network. Reboot both if necessary. Host or Pi logs show repeated reconnect attempts IP mismatch or DNS resolution error Edit the host IP in <code>constants.py</code> to match the Pi\u2019s assigned address. Recording button unresponsive or missing outputs FFmpeg not installed correctly Reinstall FFmpeg for Windows (via MSYS2 or prebuilt binary) and restart the GUI. Sensors or motors not responding Wiring or pin mismatch Double-check all GPIO connections. Refer to electronics.md for correct pin assignments. Camera or LDR not working properly Incorrect SPI or CSI wiring Inspect the camera ribbon orientation and ADC wiring for the LDR. Refer to electronics.md for the exact SPI pin map. <p>General Fix</p> <p>If you encounter repeated errors, dependency issues, or broken imports \u2014  re-run the entire Software Setup guide step-by-step.
