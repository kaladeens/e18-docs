GStreamer not found / \u201cnot in PATH\u201d error PATH variable not updated Add <code>C:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin</code> to the System Path environment variable and restart your terminal or VS Code. <code>pkg-config</code> or compiler errors during install Incomplete MSYS2 setup Re-run the MSYS2 setup and package installation section from Software Setup. GUI opens but window stays blank Missing dependencies or mismatch between Python version and PyQt Ensure Python \u22653.11 and reinstall dependencies: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>. Pi does not auto-reconnect after disconnect Network drop or static IP conflict Ensure both host and Pi are on the same Wi-Fi. Restart both devices if necessary. Host or Pi logs show repeated reconnect attempts IP mismatch or hostname not resolving Edit the IP in <code>constants.py</code> to match the Pi\u2019s assigned address. Recording button unresponsive or missing outputs FFmpeg not installed correctly Reinstall FFmpeg Executable fails to launch Missing system DLLs or incomplete PyInstaller build Rebuild using the same environment with:  <code>pyinstaller --noconsole --icon=icons/in.ico gui_main.py</code>. <p>General Fix</p> <p>If you encounter repeated issues with dependencies, terminal errors, or broken imports \u2014 re-run the entire Software Setup guide step-by-step. Most problems are caused by skipped setup commands, wrong terminals, or missing environment variables.</p> <p>Quick Diagnostic Commands</p> <p>Use these commands to verify core components:</p> <pre><code># Check connected audio devices\narecord -l\n\n# Confirm camera module is detected\nlibcamera-hello --list-cameras\n\n# Verify Python environment and path\npython --version\nwhich python\n\n# Test if GUI can reach payload\nping bushbot.local\n</code></pre> <p>Rebuilding MSYS2 Environment (Windows Only)</p> <p>If GStreamer or PyGObject installation fails repeatedly, open MSYS2 MSYS terminal and reset the environment:</p> <pre><code>pacman -Syu\npacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain \\\n          mingw-w64-x86_64-gstreamer \\\n          mingw-w64-x86_64-gst-plugins-base \\\n          mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config\n</code></pre> <p>Then open MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit terminal and reinstall Python bindings:</p> <pre><code>source venv/Scripts/activate\npip install PyGObject\n</code></pre> <p>After completing these steps, repeat Section 2 \u2013 GStreamer Installation in Software Setup.</p> <p>!!! wiring is a big issie //camera issues</p>"}]}
