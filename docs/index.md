# ðŸ¦˜ The BushBot Initiative  

Welcome to the **BushBot Initiative** â€” an AI-powered wildlife monitoring platform designed for the **non-intrusive observation** of Australian fauna.  


The system combines an intelligent **Raspberry Piâ€“based payload** (camera, microphone, and light sensor) with a **host PC** that performs real-time species detection, classification, and peripheral control. Together, they provide a compact, efficient, and environmentally conscious solution for wildlife research and education.

## ðŸ§© System Overview

The BushBot architecture consists of three main components:

- **Onboard Payload:** Captures video, audio, and ambient light data in real time.  
- **Host PC:** Runs AI inference, GUI, data logging, and remote command functions.  
- **Communication Link:** Wi-Fi channel enabling live control, telemetry, and data transmission between the host and payload.

This modular design allows for easy maintenance, flexible upgrades, and seamless collaboration between electrical and robotics systems.
