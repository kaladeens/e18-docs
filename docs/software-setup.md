# Software Setup

This section explains how to install and configure the software for both the **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** and the **Host Control PC**, preparing BushBot for its first run.

---

## Raspberry Pi Setup

The Raspberry Pi handles onboard data acquisition, servo actuation, and communication with the host.

---

### Step 1 – Flash the Project Image

1. Open **Raspberry Pi Imager** on your computer.  
2. Select:  
   - **Choose OS → Use Custom Image → bushbot.img**  
   - **Choose Storage →** your microSD card  
3. Click the ⚙️ **Advanced Options** icon and set:  
   - **Hostname:** `bushbot.local`  
   - **Enable SSH:** checked with a password  
   - **Configure Wireless LAN:** enter SSID and password  
4. Click **Write** and wait until the process completes.  
5. Insert the card into the Pi and power it on.

!!! warning "First Boot Notice"
    The onboard LED will flash during startup.  
    **Do not disconnect power** until it stops flashing.

---

### Step 2 – Clone the Repository

After connecting the Pi to Wi-Fi:

```
ssh admin@bushbot.local
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y
git clone git@github.com:kaladeens/e18.git
cd e18/rpi
```

---

### Step 3 – Install Dependencies

Run the automated setup script:

```
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```

> Installation may take several minutes and will reboot automatically when finished.

---

### Step 4 – Run the Main Application

After reboot:

```
ssh admin@bushbot.local
cd e18/rpi
./run.sh
```

The Pi now begins streaming video, audio, and telemetry to the host PC.

---

## Host Control PC Setup

The host computer runs the GUI, AI models, and data logging.

---

### Step 1 – Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```
cd e18/host
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment:

* **Windows**
  ```powershell
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
* **macOS / Linux**
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

Install required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Step 2 – Install GStreamer (Windows Only)

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).  
2. Open **MSYS2 MSYS** and run:  
   ```
   pacman -Syu
   pacman -Su
   pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-gstreamer mingw-w64-x86_64-gst-plugins-base mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config
   ```
3. Launch *MINGW64* terminal → navigate to your project → activate venv → run:  
   ```
   pip install PyGObject
   ```
4. Add to System Path: `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin`  
5. Restart VS Code or your terminal.

---

### Step 3 – Launch the GUI

```
cd e18/host/bushbot_gui_v2
python gui_main.py
```

If configured correctly, the GUI connects automatically and displays live video and audio feeds.

---

### Step 4 – Optional Executable Build

```
pyinstaller --noconsole --icon=icons/in.ico gui_main.py
```
